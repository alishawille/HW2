# HW2

This repository contains my Homework 2 Assignment.

The data is profs.csv, bikeshare.csv, capmetro_UT.csv, and billboard.csv. billboard.csv can be found under 'files' in the course Canvas page, and the rest of the data files are linked here.

To reproduce my results:

Download the HW2.Rmd file and the profs.csv, bikeshare.csv, capmetro_UT.csv, and billboard.csv files
Place the files in your working directory in Rstudio
Open "HW2.Rmd" in Rstudio and run all code
Knit the file
Once the following steps are completed, you should be able to reproduce my report exactly.
